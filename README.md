# STROKE PREDICTION USING CT SCANNED IMAGES


# COMING SOON


Developed a Stroke Prediction model using CT Scanned images.
Used machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on CT scanned images.
• Utilized demographic information such as age, smoking status, BMI, and ancestral stroke history for initial analysis and feature engineering.
• Gathered CT scanned image datasets of patients along with demographic information.
• Pre-processed the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure compatibility with machine learning models. Extracted relevant features from demographic information, including age, smoking status, BMI, and ancestral stroke history.
• Utilized domain knowledge to engineer new features and select the most predictive ones for the stroke prediction model. Trained machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks on the pre-processed data.
• Used techniques like cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and assess model performance.
• Integrated CT scanned images into the predictive model using deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
• Utilized transfer learning from pre-trained models or developed custom CNN architectures to extract features from the images.
• Validated the predictive model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Interpreted model predictions to understand the factors contributing to stroke risk and provided actionable insights for healthcare practitioners.
• To further enhance the interpretability of the predictive model for stroke prediction using CT scanned image dataset's, techniques like LIME Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations and SHAP SHapley Additive exPlanations was employed.
• Implemented object detection, tracking, recognition, and classification techniques across various AI domains, including ML/DL, CV, and NLP.
• Participated in research activities to stay updated on the latest developments in AI, computer vision, and predictive modelling, proposing innovative AI solutions.
